# Summer Body

## Goal:

- The goal of this application is to help users bulk up or slim down in order to craft their summer body, by providing nutritional data.

## Demographics:

- People aged 18+ who are interested in monitoring the nutrition value of the food that they cook.

## Motivation:

- Prompt users to find recipes and then decide which recipes to cook based on their nutrition values.

## Functionality:

- See a sorted list of hundreds of recipes.
  - When a recipe is scrolled over, see a small box that displays a description of that recipe. And provides a link to the cook it up website.
- See multiple charts containing calories, fat, sugar, and cholesterol for that recipe. 
  - Be able to toggle between the charts.
- ***Stretch goal***: Select up to 3-5 recipes and then see a bar chart which will compare fat, sugar, calories, and cholesterol for those recipes.
  - Be able to toggle between the charts.

### Technicalities:

- I will use D3.js, Node.js, React.js and Material UI for this project.
- I will be using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) similar to my first capstone.
- I will have a database containing one table: ***recipes***
  - This will include the nutrition information
  - ***Stretch goal***: Have a table for ***users*** and ***favorites*** so I can have signup and favorite-recipe capabilities.
