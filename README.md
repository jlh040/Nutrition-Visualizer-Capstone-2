# Summer Body

## Goal:

- The goal of this application is to help users bulk up or slim down in order to craft their summer body, by providing nutritional data for meals that they can cook.

## Demographics:

- This application is geared toward single men and women in their 30s who would like to be able to show off their body at the beach or at the pool.

## Functionality:

- People will be able to compare multiple recipes that can then be incorporated into their diet.
- They will be able to click a 'bulk up' or 'slim down' button, and have appropriate recipes be displayed to them.
- They will have the ability to select up to 3 recipes from a scrollable list, and have the nutritional value for those recipes show up in a single chart.

- **Stretch goal**: They will be able to see which recipes, among selected recipes, have the maximum amount of protein and minimum amount of fat.

### Technicalities:

- I will use D3.js, Node.js, React.js and Material UI for this project.
- I will be using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) similar to my first capstone.
- All recipe data will be captured via API calls from a class.
- ***Stretch goal***: Have a table for ***users*** and ***favorites*** so I can have signup and favorite-recipe capabilities.
