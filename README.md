# Summer Body

## Goal:

- The goal of this application is to help users craft their summer body, by providing nutritional data for their meals.

## Demographics:

- This application is geared toward single people in their 30s who would like to show off their body.

## Functionality:

- Users will be able to compare the nutritional data of multiple recipes.
- They will be able to select between two goals: 'bulk up' or 'slim down', then the system will show recipes matching their intentions.
- **Stretch goal**: Have a way for people to sign up and favorite recipes.

### Technicalities:

- I will use D3.js, Node.js, React.js and Material UI for this project.
- I will be using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) similar to my first capstone.
- All recipe data will be captured via API calls from a class.
- ***Stretch goal***: Have a table for ***users*** and ***favorites*** so I can have signup and favorite-recipe capabilities.
